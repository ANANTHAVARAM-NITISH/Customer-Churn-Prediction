This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. The dataset includes customer attributes such as CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, and EstimatedSalary. Data preprocessing involves removing irrelevant columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname), encoding categorical variables (Geography, Gender), and standardizing numerical features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Three models—Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier—are trained and evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. This project helps in understanding customer behavior and identifying factors that contribute to churn.
